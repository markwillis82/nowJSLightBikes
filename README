I still have some outstanding issues, but they game is mostly there.

	Collision detection is a bit excited at times
	May have some network lag, all bike coordinates are sent on move change
	Add some graphics to the bikes rather then dots
	Change waiting message / game over message
	

Playing over local LAN is best as the network lag is minimal. I would like to continue to fix the collision detection (Player 2 works but I cant get Player 1 to work)
